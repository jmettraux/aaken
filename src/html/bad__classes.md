# Classes

<!--
There are only three core classes, `Fighter`, `Dabster`, and `Caster`, but they can be mixed in pairs (three plus three classes in total).

The vast majority of people belong to the classes `Fighter` and `Dabster`. People are categorized as _fighter_, _cleric_, or _commoner_. Classes are technical.

Adventurers are probably travellers, pilgrims, traders, vagabonds, gyrovagues, or hired hands on a mission. One who wields a spear is probably a fighter, you'd have to see them fight to ascertain that, the man with a tonsure is a cleric, or someone posing as one.

Each class is presented with a table detailing the count of each item an adventurer get upon levelling up. Character creation counts as levelling up (to 1st level).

[^1]

Before rolling for count, roll a d20 against the given `TC`, if successful then the count dice is rolled twice with the best result kept (like when rolling with advantage). For example, a fighter successfully rolling 1d20 against their `CON TC` may roll 2d8 pick the best and add 3 to determine their new HP max.

Traits are a bit different. A character receives _attempts_, they can be used to acquire a trait or to enhance it (from _regular_, to _very_, to _highly_). An attempt is a roll against the trait given `TC`, if successful the trait is acquired or enhanced, else too bad.

Option:

to speed things up, instead of advantage, on TC check success get the max, else the min.

## Fighter

A character with the `Fighter` class isn't necessarily a professional soldier, it's a person with an inclination for weapons. They may be a priest or a farmer, but they know how to fight.

## Caster

At some point during their childhood, the `Caster`'s gift was revealed and they understood they were different and had to conceal that difference. Some of them are very talented, some others less so but were lucky enough to find someone whose trail they could walk in.
