# Traits

A trait is a qualifier denoting a special capability or a talent of a character or a creature. A trait comes in three level _(no prefix)_, _very_, or _highly_.

Upon creation and levelling up, characters get 2 or 3 attempts at traits, depending on their class. An attempt is a roll against a `TC`, the trait dictactes what `TC`. If the roll is successful, the trait is acquired, or, if already acquired, it goes up one level (_highly_ is the maximum).

· _(no prefix)_ → ·· ~~_very_~~ → ··· ~~_highly_~~
